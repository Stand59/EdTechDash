This text is designed to guide novice researchers through the process of creating surveys for the purpose of conducting research.<\/p>","cover_image_sm":"159_sm_10-04-2021_205920.png","cover_image_md":"159_md_10-04-2021_205920.png","cover_image_lg":"159_lg_10-04-2021_205920.png","last_updated":"2020-05-05 15:37:40","major_version":0,"minor_version":330,"page_views":1478,"pdf_downloads":568,"progress":1,"published":1,"name":"badge_expert_author","value":"Designing Surveys for Evaluations and Research","links":{"html":"https:\/\/edtechbooks.org\/designing_surveys","qr_image":"https:\/\/edtechbooks.org\/content_images\/designing_surveys\/qr\/1.png","book_cover_images":{"twitter":"https:\/\/edtechbooks.org\/book_cover_images\/0_twitter.jpg","sm":"https:\/\/edtechbooks.org\/book_cover_images\/159_sm_10-04-2021_205920.png","md":"https:\/\/edtechbooks.org\/book_cover_images\/159_md_10-04-2021_205920.png","lg":"https:\/\/edtechbooks.org\/book_cover_images\/159_lg_10-04-2021_205920.png"},"pdf_external":null,"pdf_mobile":"https:\/\/edtechbooks.org\/designing_surveys\/pdf_router\/mobile","pdf_print":"https:\/\/edtechbooks.org\/designing_surveys\/pdf_router\/print"},"qr_id":1,"show_pdf":"1","id":159},"24":{"book_id":71,"short_name":"second_language_literacy","title":"Developing Second Language Literacy","subtitle":"","abstract":"","cover_image_sm":"71_sm_07-15-2020_102625.jpg","cover_image_md":"71_md_07-15-2020_102625.jpg","cover_image_lg":"71_lg_07-15-2020_102624.jpg","last_updated":"2020-03-19 17:44:14","major_version":0,"minor_version":46,"page_views":1757,"pdf_downloads":0,"progress":1,"published":1,"name":"collection_as_series","value":"Developing Second Language Literacy","links":{"html":"https:\/\/edtechbooks.org\/second_language_literacy","qr_image":"https:\/\/edtechbooks.org\/content_images\/second_language_literacy\/qr\/1.png","book_cover_images":{"twitter":"https:\/\/edtechbooks.org\/book_cover_images\/0_twitter.jpg","sm":"https:\/\/edtechbooks.org\/book_cover_images\/71_sm_07-15-2020_102625.jpg","md":"https:\/\/edtechbooks.org\/book_cover_images\/71_md_07-15-2020_102625.jpg","lg":"https:\/\/edtechbooks.org\/book_cover_images\/71_lg_07-15-2020_102624.jpg"},"pdf_external":null},"qr_id":1,"id":71},"25":{"book_id":225,"short_name":"digital_navigator_toolkit","title":"Digital Navigator Toolkit","subtitle":"","abstract":"","cover_image_sm":"225_sm_02-10-2021_115115.png","cover_image_md":"225_md_02-10-2021_115115.png","cover_image_lg":"225_lg_02-10-2021_115114.png","last_updated":"2020-11-18 04:46:42","major_version":0,"minor_version":62,"page_views":1345,"pdf_downloads":216,"progress":1,"published":1,"name":"exclude_qa_survey","value":"Digital Navigator Toolkit","links":{"html":"https:\/\/edtechbooks.org\/digital_navigator_toolkit","qr_image":"https:\/\/edtechbooks.org\/content_images\/digital_navigator_toolkit\/qr\/1.png","book_cover_images":{"twitter":"https:\/\/edtechbooks.org\/book_cover_images\/0_twitter.jpg","sm":"https:\/\/edtechbooks.org\/book_cover_images\/225_sm_02-10-2021_115115.png","md":"https:\/\/edtechbooks.org\/book_cover_images\/225_md_02-10-2021_115115.png","lg":"https:\/\/edtechbooks.org\/book_cover_images\/225_lg_02-10-2021_115114.png"},"pdf_external":null,"pdf_mobile":"https:\/\/edtechbooks.org\/digital_navigator_toolkit\/pdf_router\/mobile","pdf_print":"https:\/\/edtechbooks.org\/digital_navigator_toolkit\/pdf_router\/print"},"qr_id":1,"show_pdf":"1","id":225},"26":{"book_id":272,"short_name":"double_o_stem","title":"Double-O STEM (Educator Guide)","subtitle":"Community-Based STEM Projects for Informal Learning","abstract":"The \"Double-O-STEM\" (Educator Guide) curriculum consists of STEM problem-solving activities.

These are the hidden historical artifacts of educational technology.<\/p>\r\n<p id=\"p_sbdR\">In this volume, we want to bring these blog posts together for future reading and dialogue.

This book focuses on explicating the ontological and epistemological underpinnings of user-centered design and user experience as applied in the field of Learning\/Instructional Design and Technology with the goal of foregrounding the importance of learner experience as an emerging design paradigm for the field. This volume is comprised of 15 chapters and organized into three parts: (1) Methods and Paradigms (5 chapters), (2) Conceptual and Design Frameworks (6 chapters), and (3) LX Design-in-practice (4 chapters). This volume serves as a contribution to an emerging, transdisciplinary, and complex phenomenon that requires multiple literacies. LX is not only concerned with the effectiveness of designed learning interventions, but also with the interconnected and interdependent relationship between the learner- (or the teacher-\/instructor-) as-user, the designed technology, novel pedagogical techniques or instructional strategies, and the learning context. The diversity and breadth of perspectives presented herein serve as a topographical sketch of the emerging focus area of learner experience and represent an opportunity to build upon this work in the future.","cover_image_sm":"36_sm_09-29-2020_235754.png","cover_image_md":"36_md_09-29-2020_235754.png","cover_image_lg":"36_lg_09-29-2020_235753.png","last_updated":"2020-04-14 20:47:45","major_version":0,"minor_version":498,"page_views":14165,"pdf_downloads":3667,"progress":1,"published":1,"name":"badge_expert_author","value":"Learner and User Experience Research","links":{"html":"https:\/\/edtechbooks.org\/ux","qr_image":"https:\/\/edtechbooks.org\/content_images\/ux\/qr\/1.png","book_cover_images":{"twitter":"https:\/\/edtechbooks.org\/book_cover_images\/0_twitter.jpg","sm":"https:\/\/edtechbooks.org\/book_cover_images\/36_sm_09-29-2020_235754.png","md":"https:\/\/edtechbooks.org\/book_cover_images\/36_md_09-29-2020_235754.png","lg":"https:\/\/edtechbooks.org\/book_cover_images\/36_lg_09-29-2020_235753.png"},"pdf_external":null,"pdf_mobile":"https:\/\/edtechbooks.org\/ux\/pdf_router\/mobile","pdf_print":"https:\/\/edtechbooks.org\/ux\/pdf_router\/print"},"qr_id":1,"show_pdf":"1","id":36},"48":{"book_id":147,"short_name":"learning_management_systems","title":"Learning Management Systems","subtitle":"Choosing the Right Path For Your Organization","abstract":"<p>This book explores main concepts and topics involved in the process of managing Learning Management Systems (LMS) in corporate or educational settings.

In this book, we'll review the reasons why asynchronous video should be an important tool in an online teacher's toolbox, and discuss practical strategies for integrating these tools into your teaching.<\/p><p>This material was written with the support of EdConnect and <a href=\"https:\/\/er.educause.edu\/blogs\/2021\/2\/the-power-of-asynchronous-video\" data-shortened-url=\"https:\/\/edtechbooks.org\/-EEni\" data-unshortened-url=\"https:\/\/er.educause.edu\/blogs\/2021\/2\/the-power-of-asynchronous-video\">previously published in a series of articles in Educause Review<\/a>.<\/p>","cover_image_sm":"245_sm_10-05-2021_172123.png","cover_image_md":"245_md_10-05-2021_172123.png","cover_image_lg":"245_lg_10-05-2021_172122.png","last_updated":"2021-02-26 16:26:47","major_version":0,"minor_version":38,"page_views":1037,"pdf_downloads":531,"progress":1,"published":1,"name":"rebuild_epub","value":"Teaching With Asynchronous Video","links":{"html":"https:\/\/edtechbooks.org\/asynchronous_video","qr_image":"https:\/\/edtechbooks.org\/content_images\/asynchronous_video\/qr\/1.png","book_cover_images":{"twitter":"https:\/\/edtechbooks.org\/book_cover_images\/0_twitter.jpg","sm":"https:\/\/edtechbooks.org\/book_cover_images\/245_sm_10-05-2021_172123.png","md":"https:\/\/edtechbooks.org\/book_cover_images\/245_md_10-05-2021_172123.png","lg":"https:\/\/edtechbooks.org\/book_cover_images\/245_lg_10-05-2021_172122.png"},"pdf_external":null,"pdf_mobile":"https:\/\/edtechbooks.org\/asynchronous_video\/pdf_router\/mobile","pdf_print":"https:\/\/edtechbooks.org\/asynchronous_video\/pdf_router\/print"},"qr_id":1,"show_pdf":"1","id":245},"63":{"book_id":109,"short_name":"digitaltoolsapps","title":"Teaching with Digital Tools and Apps","subtitle":"","abstract":"<p>This eBook highlights the key steps and considerations for finding, evaluating, and teaching with digital tools and apps.<\/p>","cover_image_sm":"109_sm_03-30-2020_151111.png","cover_image_md":"109_md_03-30-2020_151111.png","cover_image_lg":"109_lg_03-30-2020_151111.png","last_updated":"2020-04-12 20:37:20","major_version":1,"minor_version":112,"page_views":7720,"pdf_downloads":4303,"progress":1,"published":1,"name":"badge_expert_author","value":"Teaching with Digital Tools and Apps","links":{"html":"https:\/\/edtechbooks.org\/digitaltoolsapps","qr_image":"https:\/\/edtechbooks.org\/content_images\/digitaltoolsapps\/qr\/1.png","book_cover_images":{"twitter":"https:\/\/edtechbooks.org\/book_cover_images\/0_twitter.jpg","sm":"https:\/\/edtechbooks.org\/book_cover_images\/109_sm_03-30-2020_151111.png","md":"https:\/\/edtechbooks.org\/book_cover_images\/109_md_03-30-2020_151111.png","lg":"https:\/\/edtechbooks.org\/book_cover_images\/109_lg_03-30-2020_151111.png"},"pdf_external":null,"pdf_mobile":"https:\/\/edtechbooks.org\/digitaltoolsapps\/pdf_router\/mobile","pdf_print":"https:\/\/edtechbooks.org\/digitaltoolsapps\/pdf_router\/print"},"qr_id":1,"show_pdf":"1","id":109},"64":{"book_id":114,"short_name":"ptd8","title":"TELL Practicum Guidelines","subtitle":"Linking the Practicum Projects to the TELL Learning Outcomes ","abstract":"","cover_image_sm":"114_sm_10-12-2020_094110.jpg","cover_image_md":"114_md_10-12-2020_094110.jpg","cover_image_lg":"114_lg_10-12-2020_094110.jpg","last_updated":"2019-09-10 16:52:20","major_version":0,"minor_version":150,"page_views":753,"pdf_downloads":0,"progress":1,"published":1,"name":"rebuild_epub","value":"TELL Practicum Guidelines","links":{"html":"https:\/\/edtechbooks.org\/ptd8","qr_image":"https:\/\/edtechbooks.org\/content_images\/ptd8\/qr\/1.png","book_cover_images":{"twitter":"https:\/\/edtechbooks.org\/book_cover_images\/0_twitter.jpg","sm":"https:\/\/edtechbooks.org\/book_cover_images\/114_sm_10-12-2020_094110.jpg","md":"https:\/\/edtechbooks.org\/book_cover_images\/114_md_10-12-2020_094110.jpg","lg":"https:\/\/edtechbooks.org\/book_cover_images\/114_lg_10-12-2020_094110.jpg"},"pdf_external":null},"qr_id":1,"id":114},"65":{"book_id":160,"short_name":"textiles_tapestries_self_study","title":"Textiles and Tapestries","subtitle":"Self-Study for Envisioning New Ways of Knowing","abstract":"<p><em>Textiles and Tapestries<\/em> presents thought-provoking research that explores the intricate and complex weavings of teaching and learning. It reflects a compelling mixture of traditional and contemporary methodology, collaborations within and beyond teacher education, and allows space for considering the implications of current worldwide social, political, and systemic tensions.

Authors from thirteen different countries describe their experiences of using the approach in a variety of contexts such as  art, school education, higher education, digital learning, work, green education, personal learning, online learning, elementary learning, and research education. The book is designed for the practitioner by focussing on how to apply heutagogy within their own area of interest. The context of the book is learner agency, which we think should be the guiding principle underpinning education and preparing citizens to cope with the twenty-first century.
